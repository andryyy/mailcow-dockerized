# Info and documentation

Please see [the official documentation](https://mailcow.github.io/mailcow-dockerized-docs/) for instructions.

# Before You Begin: Prerequisites
- **Please remove any web and mail services** running on your server. I recommend using a clean Debian minimal installation.
Remember to purge Debian's default MTA Exim4:
```
apt-get purge exim4*
``` 

- If there is a firewall, unblock the following ports for incoming connections:

| Service               | Protocol | Port   |
| -------------------   |:--------:|:-------|
| Postfix Submission    | TCP      | 587    |
| Postfix SMTPS         | TCP      | 465    |
| Postfix SMTP          | TCP      | 25     |
| Dovecot IMAP          | TCP      | 143    |
| Dovecot IMAPS         | TCP      | 993    |
| Dovecot POP3          | TCP      | 110    |
| Dovecot POP3S         | TCP      | 995    |
| Dovecot ManageSieve   | TCP      | 4190   |
| HTTP(S)               | TCP      | 80/443 |

- Setup DNS records:

Obviously you will need an A and/or AAAA record `sys_hostname.sys_domain` pointing to your IP address and a valid MX record.
*Let's Encrypt does not assign certificates when it cannot determine a valid* **IPv4** *address.*

| Name                       | Type   | Value                        | Priority   |
| ---------------------------|:------:|:----------------------------:|:-----------|
| `sys_hostname.sys_domain`  | A/AAAA | IPv4/6                       | any        |
| `sys_domain`               | MX     | `sys_hostname.sys_domain`    | 25         |

**Optional:** Auto-configuration services for Thunderbird (and derivates) + ActiveSync.
You do not need to setup `autodiscover` when not using SOGo with ActiveSync.

| Name                       | Type   | Value                        | Priority   |
| ---------------------------|:------:|:----------------------------:|:-----------|
| autoconfig.`sys_domain`    | A/AAAA | IPv4/6                       | any        |
| autodiscover.`sys_domain`  | A/AAAA | IPv4/6                       | any        |

**Hint:** ActiveSync auto-discovery is setup to configure desktop clients with IMAP!

Further DNS records for SPF and DKIM are recommended. These entries will raise trust in your mailserver, reduce abuse of your domain name and increase authenticity.

Find more details about mailcow DNS entries and SPF/DKIM related configuration in our wiki article on [DNS Records](https://github.com/andryyy/mailcow/wiki/DNS-records).

- Next it is important that you **do not use Google DNS** or another public DNS which is known to be blocked by DNS-based Blackhole List (DNSBL) providers.
